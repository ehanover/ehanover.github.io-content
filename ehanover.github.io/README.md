### About the website
I had trouble deciding what framework to use when creating this site. I was worried that picking a large web framework like React or Angular would be silly and impractical, but I eventually decided that using React for this project would be a good way to learn some of the basics. In the past, I've enjoyed using Vue but I wanted to learn something new.

The majority of the challenge of this website is making a look pretty which has always been a challenge for me. I'd like to think that the project descriptions in the website make up for my lack of hipster UI.
