# Personal Website - ehanover.github.io

## About the website
I had trouble deciding what framework to use when creating this site. I was worried that picking a large web framework like React or Angular would be silly and impractical, but I eventually decided that using React for this project would be a good way to learn some of the basics. In the past, I've enjoyed using Vue but I wanted to learn something new.

The majority of the challenge of this website is making a look pretty which has always been a challenge for me. I'd like to think that the project descriptions in the website make up for my lack of hipster UI.

## Website features (TODO)
* Carousel
* Markdown rendering

## Website content
I wanted a way to be able to change the content of the website (text like you're reading now) without changing the code that runs the website. To achieve this, I moved all the website content to another GitHub repository. Using GitHub to host static content doesn't seem super normal, but it works for now and it would be easy to migrate the data in the future if needed.
