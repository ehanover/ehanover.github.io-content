# OpenWeatherMap Weather Widget

Home screen widgets are a fun and effective way of communicating little bits of information, and they're satisfying to develop because you can appreciate them any time you turn on your phone!

I wanted this widget to display some aspect of the weather information in a way that is understandable with only a quick glance. I decided that each of the day rows on the widget shows a color gradient that starts at the day high temperature and ends at the day low temperature. The higher a temperature is, the brighter its color is, so it's easy to compare temperatures without having to read numbers. One downside to the color gradient idea is that it's tricky to make the colors created by the gradient look good with the rest colors on the widget, but overall I think it's a neat effect.

## Extensions
* Add a new color scheme?
* Replace the widget ListView with a table so that the data in each row can be aligned
* Add a "save changes" button to the app instead of text change listeners
