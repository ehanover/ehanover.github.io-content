# OpenWeatherMap Weather Widget

Creating a home screen widget is an effective way of communicating information and it's something that I'll actually use and be able to appreciate in the future. Unfortunately, all widgets are for Android only.

I wanted the widget to display some of the weather information in a way that is easy to see at a glance. I decided that each of the day elements on the widget should have a gradient that starts at the day high temperature and ends at the day low temperature. A downside to this idea is that I don't know how to make the strange gradient colors look good with the rest of the widget. I always struggle with the graphic design aspects.

This weather API only provides 5 days of weather compared to the 7 in [my other weather widget](https://ehanover.github.io/weatherwidget-darksky)

### Extensions
* Add a new color scheme
* Replace the widget ListView with a table so that columns can be aligned
* Add a "save changes" button to the app instead of text change listeners
